# Decentralized Travel System (DTS)

The **Decentralized Travel System (DTS)** is a blockchain-based solution designed to empower travelers by providing a transparent, secure, and decentralized platform for booking, payments, and reviews. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, DTS aims to eliminate intermediaries, reduce costs, and ensure a more seamless travel experience.

## Key Features

1. **Decentralized Booking**
   - Peer-to-peer booking for hotels, flights, and activities without intermediaries.
   - Smart contracts handle reservations, ensuring secure and automated transactions.

2. **Transparent Reviews**
   - Immutable, decentralized review system to ensure authenticity and credibility.
   - Reviews stored on-chain to prevent tampering or deletion.

3. **Tokenized Payments**
   - Integrated support for cryptocurrencies for fast, global payments.
   - Optional reward systems for loyal users using platform tokens.

4. **Secure Identity Verification**
   - Decentralized identity (DID) integration to streamline user verification.
   - Zero-knowledge proofs ensure privacy while maintaining compliance.

5. **Customizable Applications**
   - Open-source framework allowing developers to build custom travel dApps on top of DTS.

## Why Blockchain?

Traditional travel platforms suffer from high fees, centralized control, and lack of transparency. Blockchain solves these issues by:

- Eliminating intermediaries, reducing costs for both travelers and service providers.
- Ensuring data integrity through immutable ledgers.
- Enhancing trust with decentralized governance and peer-to-peer mechanisms.

## Testnet Considerations

DTS is currently deployed on testnets for development and testing purposes. While testnets provide a safe environment to experiment with new features, they come with certain limitations:

1. **Limited Scalability:**
   - Testnets often have slower transaction speeds and lower throughput compared to mainnets.

2. **Test Tokens Only:**
   - Payments and rewards are conducted using testnet tokens with no real-world value.

3. **Frequent Downtime:**
   - Testnets may experience disruptions or resets, leading to temporary loss of data or availability.

4. **Smart Contract Testing:**
   - Smart contracts are under active development. Bugs or vulnerabilities may still exist, so they should not be considered production-ready.

5. **Community Feedback:**
   - Testnet deployment allows the community to provide valuable feedback before the mainnet launch.

### Transition to Mainnet
We aim to transition to a mainnet deployment after rigorous testing, security audits, and community validation to ensure a robust, scalable, and secure system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install a blockchain wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
2. Connect to the supported testnet (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia, or Polygon Mumbai).
3. Acquire testnet tokens for transactions. (Faucet links are provided below.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/decentralized-travel-system.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd decentralized-travel-system
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
